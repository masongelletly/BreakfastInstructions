This project provides user documentation meant to guide in the creation of 4 different recipes of breakfast. Use these instructions for an effortless, delicious morning. The instructions are fine tuned to my personal apartment (meant for roomate and mom), but the core recipes will remain effective for any kitchen's use.

To use this documentation, open the index.md file. This file acts as a table of contents for the documentation and will allow you to access each and every portion of instruction. This file is pivotal, as any and all traversal between files relies on index.md. 

Good luck, and happy eating!
